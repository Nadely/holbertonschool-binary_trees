C - Binary Trees

This project focuses on binary trees and their manipulation using the C language.
A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, which are referred to as the left child and the right child.

Tree terminology is not well-standardized and so varies in literatures.

- A full binary tree (sometimes referred to as a proper or plane or strict binary tree) is a tree in which every node has either 0 or 2 children. Another way of defining a full binary tree is a recursive definition. A full binary tree is either
A single vertex (a single node as the root node).
A tree whose root node has two subtrees, both of which are full binary trees.

-A perfect binary tree is a binary tree in which all interior nodes have two children and all leaves have the same depth or same level (the level of a node defined as the number of edges or links from the root node to a node). An example of a perfect binary tree is the ancestry chart of a person to a given depth less than that at which an ancestor would appear more than once in the chart (at which point the chart is no longer a tree with unique nodes; note that the same ancestor can appear at different depths in the chart), as each person has exactly two biological parents (one mother and one father). Provided the ancestry chart always displays the mother and the father on the same side for a given node, their sex can be seen as an analogy of left and right children, children being understood here as an algorithmic term. A perfect binary tree is a full binary tree, but the converse of this is not necessarily true.

-A complete binary tree is a binary tree in which every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between 1 and 2h nodes at the last level h. A perfect tree is therefore always complete but a complete tree is not necessarily perfect. Some authors use the term complete to refer instead to a perfect binary tree as defined above, in which case they call this type of tree (with a possibly not filled last level) an almost complete binary tree or nearly complete binary tree. A complete binary tree can be efficiently represented using an array.

-A balanced binary tree is a binary tree structure in which the left and right subtrees of every node differ in height (the number of edges from the top-most node to the farthest node in a subtree) by no more than 1. One may also consider binary trees where no leaf is much farther away from the root than any other leaf. (Different balancing schemes allow different definitions of "much farther".)
